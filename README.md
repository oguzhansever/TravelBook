# TravelBook

In Atil Samancioglu's training course, I created a TravelBook project. In this project, users add pins on maps and specialize it. On the list they see added pins and can call back. 

In this project I have learned,

- how to work with CoreData

- how to use MapKit 

- notion of CoreLocation
